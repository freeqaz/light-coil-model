This one feels pretty good. Doesn't have any handles on it, but it's solid enough to flow with. Prints well with 0.8mm nozzle in Atomix UV Green PETG.

Definitely a big boi. The handle snapped on the top when printing with translucent blue PETG from Bambu. Going to try out
2024-11-19_12-39-19_coil__38c_0.34h_0.82mm_8w_19h_2.5x.3mf
and see if it's better. It has a shorter height.

Yeah the Translucent Blue PETG is a quite brittle. Chris broke it while just using it as a normal slinky. 

Printed with ironing in concentric mode worked. Will need to iterate with Thicker Bridges and determine if that's 
actually helpful or not. It requires an increase in layer height, for sure.

Also testing 2024-11-19_12-40-42_coil__5c_0.34h_0.82mm_8w_19h_2.7x.3mf to see if layer separation is better.

Trying to replicate the slinky from Subtronics that was printed with 0.6mm nozzle. This one is the same dimensions, though
slightlyyy wider which I think should improve the slop. Hopefully it comes out well!

Results: Solid but maybe a little too rigid. Going to round it down by a bit and try again.

Also a bit too long. Decreasing coil radius to 81mm for Nova.

Champion. So good!

5. Polycarbonate -- clear from Bambu Labs

It printed well at 2.3x. It looks like it used the same config I have for PETG which is wild that it worked so well on the first try. 

Going to print 2024-11-24_13-50-52_coil__35c_0.34h_0.82mm_5.739999999999999w_24h_2.5x.3mf now
